# About

My first full stack project that I made for school.

In the Backend I use C#.

I use the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to get the weather data and I use [ipinfo.io](https://ipinfo.io/) to get the location data for the project.

Read more about the Backend [here](./Backend/README.md)

In the Frontend I use vue.js and tailwind css.
